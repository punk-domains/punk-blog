Yes, but they only do it on Ethereum L1 and (for now) only with .eth. Punk Domains allows many different top-level domains (TLDs), such as .web3, .gnosis, .ape, .op etc. And it runs on multiple chains.\nPunk Domains enables anyone to create a TLD, operate it and earn revenue from it. For example, a DeFi protocol like Agave could create a TLD named .agave, and the revenue from each domain purchase would go to Agave treasury.\nPunk Domains architecture is very flexible and it allows for various domain business models. The first one is a one-time domain purchase (no renewals), but new ones will be added in the future (like time-restricted domain ownership).\nNot just about domains Punk Domains is not just about domains (in the web2 sense of the word). Itâ€™s about identity in the web3 world. Domain name gives you a digital identity, and data attached to this identity strengthen it.\nAnother thing that Punk Domains cherishes is full decentralization. The contracts are non-upgradable and donâ€™t need any keepers (or similar outside software) to properly operate.
