Factory owner can only set a royalty in the TLD contract and nothing else.\nDomains A domain can only be held by one address, but one address can hold many domains.\nA domain can hold many pieces of data:\n The holder’s address (by default). Profile picture (an NFT that the user owns). URL (like user’s homepage or similar; this comes handy together with the Punk Domains browser plugin). Other custom data such as a Twitter handle, description, etc.  All the data is stored on-chain. Each domain is an ERC-721 NFT and can be sold on NFT marketplaces.\nAdditional resources  Docs GitHub Discord Twitter  ","wordCount":"382","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-02-28T12:05:14+02:00","dateModified":"2022-02-28T12:05:14+02:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.punk.domains/posts/how-does-it-work/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Punk Domains Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.punk.domains/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blog.punk.domains/ accesskey=h title="Punk Domains Blog (Alt + H)">Punk Domains Blog</a>
