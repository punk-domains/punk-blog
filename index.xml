Which makes it perfect for DAOs and communities.
But what are the benefits of owning a domain if you&amp;rsquo;re a DAO?
1. Unity and belonging Let&amp;rsquo;s say there&amp;rsquo;s a DAO called BestDAO with very active and excited community members. BestDAO decides to create a top-level domain (TLD) on Punk Domains called .</description></item><item><title>How does it work?</title><link>https://blog.punk.domains/posts/how-does-it-work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 12:05:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.punk.domains/posts/how-does-it-work/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s take a more technical overview of Punk Domains. The main Punk Domains engines are TLD Factory contracts.

In the future, new TLD factories will be added, each with a different business logic and each with its own mix of one-time and/or renewable TLDs/domains rules (and perhaps new business models that we haven&amp;rsquo;t thought yet about).</description></item><item><title>About Punk Domains</title><link>https://blog.punk.domains/posts/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Feb 2022 16:28:44 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.punk.domains/posts/about/</guid><description>Punk Domains allows you to register a domain name attached to your account address.
